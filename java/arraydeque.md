# ArrayQueue

```java
/**
 * Resizable-array implementation of the {@link Deque} interface.  Array
 * deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support
 * usage.  They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external
 * synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads.
 * Null elements are prohibited.  This class is likely to be faster than
 * {@link Stack} when used as a stack, and faster than {@link LinkedList}
 * when used as a queue.
 *
 * <p>Most {@code ArrayDeque} operations run in amortized constant time.
 * Exceptions include {@link #remove(Object) remove}, {@link
 * #removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence}, {@link #removeLastOccurrence
 * removeLastOccurrence}, {@link #contains contains}, {@link #iterator
 * iterator.remove()}, and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear
 * time.
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by this class's {@code iterator} method are
 * <i>fail-fast</i>: If the deque is modified at any time after the iterator
 * is created, in any way except through the iterator's own {@code remove}
 * method, the iterator will generally throw a {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
 * future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
